## This site is created using create-react-app and deployed in a serverless fasion on vercel 

### here's the link to the site: 
https://portfollios.vercel.app/


## There's another project which I intneded to test the GSAP functionality on which you can visit here: (not using react but vanilla js and parcel budndler)
https://parcel-gsap.vercel.app/
I'll put the code on this repo soon, the site currently has some performance + responsiveness issues 




if you want to clone the repo: 
u need to install the dependencies with npm install (location=global recomended) then
you can use the npm start script to run it on your own local host env
